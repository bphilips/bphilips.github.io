   Hi my name is Ben Philips. Some of my hobbies include taxidermy, blow darts, and hunting for game. I enjoy the wilderness all throughout the year at my cabin in North Dakota. There are moose, bison, and many more animals out there. On the weekends when I am free, I watch my favrite TV shows: Duck Dynasty and Fox News. I love country music, my favorite artist is Blake Shelton. My favorite shoes are Timbs b.
